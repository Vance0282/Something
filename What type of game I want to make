I want to make a Stickman RPG game. 
Where you crash on a Iland, collecting 
Stick, sand, rock, food. All
to survive, and when you make a
bout. You can sail to Ilands to 
fight, and every Iland has 
a dungeon. I am kinda bad at 
codeing and what I mean is.
I never coded in my life!
So that's what I think my game should
be like.
